# About Myself

I am Yang Xu, a software development engineer. I am actively pursuing new graduate or entry level career opportunities in the Software Development Engineering field. I worked as a web application development intern at Duke OIT, where I learned and improved skills in real-world development processes and full-stack development, mainly using the Ruby on Rails frame to develop the web application. I also have a strong interest in embedded systems and hardware field. I worked as a research assistant on a drone project. Therefore, I am not limited to front-end, back-end and full-stack development for software in Java, C/C++, Ruby, and so on, I am open to exploring various other positions such as embedded systems, hardware, and so on. I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in computer engineering at Duke University and expect to graduate next May.
